## Summary  
***Machine Learning Accelerates Identification of Priority Geological Images***  
    
***Need:*** A geotechnical consulting company needed a process to aid and speed identification of various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, and interesting features and patterns in their collection of geotechnical imagery data.

***Approach:***  
* Supervised machine learing to classify images as either Andesite, Gneiss, Marble, Quartzite, Rhyolite, or Schist.
* Unsupervised machine learning to identify images simnilar to a candidate image that contained an interesing feature or pattern.

***Requirements:*** 
* With greater than 90 percent accuracy, classify a candidate into 1 of 6 categories.
* Identify target images that have similar characteristics to the single candidate image.
* Score target images such that targets are most similar to the candidate image.
* Return n-target images based on defined input.

***Image Classification:***

***Image Similarity:***  
Two models were developed to aid and speed identification of distinguishing features and patterns in a set of geological imagery. Using an unsupervised machine learning approach and, separately, a vector-distance/ similarity approach, the models successfully identified target images such that targets were most similar to a single input candidate image. Both models yielded similar results, with some overlap in the returned target-image sets. Both the K-Means unsupervised machine learning approach and the vector-distance/ similarity approach had similar elapsed times for prediction. Fitting each model took less than a minute, with a training-set of approximately one-hundred thousand images. However, elapsed time for training the K-Means model was significantly higher than the vector-distance/ similarity approach and may present limitations as the training data scales. A/B testing was recommended to determine which model returns more valuable results.
